Hey, I'm Matt Wiggins!

I am a full stack mobile engineer based in Illinois, currently working at Casa leading a team of talented mobile engineers in building our primary mobile product. In the past I have worked as a mobile developer for companies such as John Deere, Axion.network, and The Climate Corporation.

I'm also attending the University of Illinois for a Master's in CS because I have a passion for learning and teaching.

Check out what I've been building on the [Work](https://www.wiggins.dev/work/) page!
